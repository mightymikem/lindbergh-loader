# SEGA Lindbergh Emulator

This project emulates the SEGA Lindbergh, allowing games to run on modern Linux computers to be used as replacement hardware for broken Lindbergh systems in physical arcade machines. It supports both Intel and AMD CPUs as well as Intel, NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, surround sound audio, networking and JVS pass through.

If you'd like to support the development work of this emulator, see early development builds or get support from the authors please consider [becoming a patreon here](https://www.patreon.com/LindberghLoader).

If you need any help please ask the community in the [arcade community discord](https://arcade.community).

## Building & Running

In order to build the loader you will need to install the following dependencies in a Linux environment. We recommend Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as default, but it may work in various configurations like WSL2, Debian, etc.  
Please note other dependencies might be required to run games (see the [guide](docs/guide.md)).

```shell
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git build-essential gcc-multilib freeglut3-dev:i386 libsdl2-dev:i386 libfaudio-dev:i386
```

This emulator will need access to the input devices and serial devices on your computer. You should add your user account to the following groups and then _restart your computer_.

```shell
sudo usermod -a -G dialout,input $USER
```

Then you should clone the repository, change directory into it and run make.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:lindbergh-loader/lindbergh-loader.git
cd lindbergh-loader
make
```

You should then copy the contents of the build directory to your game directory and run `./lindbergh` for the game, or `./lindbergh -t` for test mode. Please note you might need to set the game executable as "executable" using `chmod +x`.

```shell
cp -a build/* /home/games/the-house-of-the-dead-4/disk0/elf/.
cd /home/games/the-house-of-the-dead-4/disk0/elf/.
./lindbergh
```

If you'd like to change game settings copy the [default configuration file](docs/lindbergh.conf) from the repository to your game directory.

```shell
cp build/docs/lindbergh.conf /home/games/the-house-of-the-dead-4/disk0/elf/.
nano lindbergh.conf
```

Please take a look at the configuration options, supported games and known issues in the [guide](docs/guide.md).

Our project is open source, and our primary goal is to preserve and maintain Lindbergh arcade machines, ensuring they continue to operate in arcades. We encourage individuals to use the information provided for their own open source projects and contribute to the development of the loader to improve it for the benefit of the community. However, we do not permit the use of any of our code in pay-to-play/subscription/commercial ventures without prior consent from the Lindbergh Loader Development Team. If we become aware of any such use, we reserve the right to take legal action.

## Thanks

This project has been built by referencing various earlier projects and would like to extend it's thanks to everyone that has contributed to the Lindbergh scene.
